Hi my name is Chris, I'm interested in golang for video games and AI as well as python, I'm hoping to learn more about AI and REST APIs soon and am now working towards
learning how to make guis in golang.

I'm currently looking for an internship or co-op opportunity so that I can get some more advanced projects to work on in AI and REST APIs.

Email me at 647 782 5479 if you'd like to get in touch.
